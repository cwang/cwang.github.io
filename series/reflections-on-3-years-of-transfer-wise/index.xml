Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about strategies. Jesse, one of the VCs who invested in Wise explained why he thought Wise was built to last. I am equally bullish and agree with the reasons listed, a lot of which have been covered in earlier parts of this series. Here I look at a few other topics.
Fiscally responsible and disciplined It went hand-in-hand with the extreme form of autonomy that is mentioned in Part II, and let me explain.</description></item><item><title>Reflections on 3 years of (Transfer) Wise | Part IV: The Engineering Organisation</title><link>https://chenwang.org/posts/2022-08-wise-3-years-p4/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenwang.org/posts/2022-08-wise-3-years-p4/</guid><description>(^ Hackathon 2018 | Conversion Team in action among others - Daniel, Karl, Urgo &amp;amp; Michael ^)
It would have been a waste of opportunity NOT to talk specifically about the engineering organisation at Wise, as this is a topic close to my heart. I could not have had a better learning experience living and breathing the changes in those years when the organisation reacted to the growing demand.</description></item><item><title>Reflections on 3 years of (Transfer) Wise | Part III: All about People</title><link>https://chenwang.org/posts/2022-08-wise-3-years-p3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenwang.org/posts/2022-08-wise-3-years-p3/</guid><description>(^ TransferWise Summer Days 2019 ^)
I care deeply about people, equally so when I was at Wise, surrounded by a group of kind and motivated human beings.
Culture shapes people who in turn make culture I spend Part I and II covering many cultural aspects at Wise. I was curious about the early culture and its evolvement because I was not there in the beginning. The common response, when I asked this question to various people across functional areas, was that it did not change much.</description></item><item><title>Reflections on 3 years of (Transfer) Wise | Part II: Autonomy in the DNA</title><link>https://chenwang.org/posts/2022-08-wise-3-years-p2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenwang.org/posts/2022-08-wise-3-years-p2/</guid><description>(^ Autonomous team growth, 2012 - 2021 ^)
To me, the culture of Wise was anchored on two foundations: feedback and autonomy. Jessica had a good writeup on the former already. I’d like to single out autonomy which had a profound impact on how Wise operated.
I am a big fan of autonomy and its application at Wise. Towards the latter part, I look at the areas where autonomy may fall short and offer my opinions on those areas.</description></item><item><title>Reflections on 3 years of (Transfer) Wise | Part I: Mission and Values</title><link>https://chenwang.org/posts/2022-08-wise-3-years-p1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenwang.org/posts/2022-08-wise-3-years-p1/</guid><description>(^ Kristo &amp;amp; Taavet, 2014 ^)
I used to think of mission as corporate-speak, before joining Wise. I was sceptical about Wise’s mission and values in the beginning too. Later on, seeing how concrete strategies were put in place to achieve the mission, I was convinced.
I may be full of praise in this part which is unlike myself, but that is my true reflection.
A true mission attracts and motivates people “money without borders – instant, convenient, transparent and eventually free” was (and still is) the mission.</description></item></channel></rss>
