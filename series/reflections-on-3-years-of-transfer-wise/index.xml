I used to think of mission as corporate-speak, before joining Wise. I was sceptical about Wise’s mission and values in the beginning too. Later on, seeing how concrete strategies were put in place to achieve the mission, I was convinced.
I may be full of praise in this part which is unlike myself, but that is my true reflection.
A true mission attracts and motivates people “money without borders – instant, convenient, transparent and eventually free” was (and still is) the mission.</description></item></channel></rss>
