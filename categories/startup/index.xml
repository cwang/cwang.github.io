I care deeply about people, equally so when I was at Wise, surrounded by a group of kind and motivated human beings.
Culture shapes people who in turn make culture I spend Part I and II covering many cultural aspects at Wise. I was curious about the early culture and its evolvement because I was not there in the beginning. The common response, when I asked this question to various people across functional areas, was that it did not change much.</description></item><item><title>Reflections on 3 years of (Transfer) Wise | Part II: Autonomy in the DNA</title><link>https://chenwang.org/posts/2022-08-wise-3-years-p2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenwang.org/posts/2022-08-wise-3-years-p2/</guid><description>(^ Autonomous team growth, 2012 - 2021 ^)
To me, the culture of Wise was anchored on two foundations: feedback and autonomy. Jessica had a good writeup on the former already. I’d like to single out autonomy which had a profound impact on how Wise operated.
I am a big fan of autonomy and its application at Wise. Towards the latter part, I look at the areas where autonomy may fall short and offer my opinions on those areas.</description></item><item><title>Reflections on 3 years of (Transfer) Wise | Part I: Mission and Values</title><link>https://chenwang.org/posts/2022-08-wise-3-years-p1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenwang.org/posts/2022-08-wise-3-years-p1/</guid><description>(^ Kristo &amp;amp; Taavet, 2014 ^)
I used to think of mission as corporate-speak, before joining Wise. I was sceptical about Wise’s mission and values in the beginning too. Later on, seeing how concrete strategies were put in place to achieve the mission, I was convinced.
I may be full of praise in this part which is unlike myself, but that is my true reflection.
A true mission attracts and motivates people “money without borders – instant, convenient, transparent and eventually free” was (and still is) the mission.</description></item><item><title>Lessons Learned in 10 years of Volcube</title><link>https://chenwang.org/posts/2021-02-volcube-10-years-series/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenwang.org/posts/2021-02-volcube-10-years-series/</guid><description>I vividly remember the early summer of 2010, when I started writing code for a stealth-mode startup. There was no name but we used a code name “project volt”. Fast forward 10 years, Volcube, as it later became known, was sold to our joint venture partner of 5 years.
Looking back, I count myself lucky as 90% of the startups fail; We managed to build a leading product in the field from scratch, with a number of customer segments spanning many countries.</description></item><item><title>Lessons Learned in 10 years of Volcube | Part III: AOB (any other business)</title><link>https://chenwang.org/posts/2021-01-volcube-10-years-p3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenwang.org/posts/2021-01-volcube-10-years-p3/</guid><description>Co-Founders: trust and complementary skills I am grateful to have Simon as the co-founder and CEO of the business. He did everything: coming up with the idea, making big or small product decisions, even writing some code in questionable quality and most importantly, making sales. I had the easy part: building it. Having complementary skills is clearly helpful from the start.
We did not know each other prior to Volcube.</description></item><item><title>Lessons Learned in 10 years of Volcube | Part II: Engineering &amp; Design</title><link>https://chenwang.org/posts/2021-01-volcube-10-years-p2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenwang.org/posts/2021-01-volcube-10-years-p2/</guid><description>Engineering: take on technical debt options and make lucky guesses Volcube is all about trading options and I think it is a closer metaphor than debt in making engineering trade-offs. Debt will have to be repaid; options can be taken up but there is no obligation. It could be useful taking a step back to imagine a product 1/3/5 years down the line, and what would be required engineering-wise that current design would make amends.</description></item><item><title>Lessons Learned in 10 years of Volcube | Part I: Product &amp; Growth</title><link>https://chenwang.org/posts/2021-01-volcube-10-years-p1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenwang.org/posts/2021-01-volcube-10-years-p1/</guid><description>Product: (the small) addressable market size Volcube was the best product in the space it occupies, which was a market-making trading simulation and education for financial options. This may sound like a boast but let me point out the fact that it is in such a niche market, which is combined with another fact that we did well in bringing a good idea into reality. Here comes the biggest learning though: always target a market with large addressable size.</description></item></channel></rss>
