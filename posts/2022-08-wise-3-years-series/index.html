It was relatively unknown if you had no need of sending money cross-border, and its brand was overshadowed by other prominent fintech companies such as Monzo and Revolut then.</p><p>(For the sake of clarity, I will use <a href=https://wise.com>Wise</a> instead of TransferWise for the company; it is the same company after all. <em>All the people mentioned were colleagues at Wise.</em>)</p><p>My motivation was clear. I wanted to find out how a so-called unicorn scales, before its eventual IPO as Wise (which I wasn’t sure if it were to come). Not many companies in London were at that stage, and I had no intention to relocate elsewhere for work. Wise was a perfect match and perhaps the only match at the time that I was able to join (thanks to Steve, Dave and Harsh not saying no during my interviews).</p><p><strong>I would be lying if I say I knew exactly what I signed up for on that day, or in the following three years. What I do know is ‘til this day I continue to benefit from my learnings from Wise.</strong></p><p>This series is my report card for my time at Wise. In true Wise spirit, I aim to offer my candid view on a number of topics.</p><ul><li><a href=https://chenwang.org/posts/2022-08-wise-3-years-p1/>Part I: Missions and Values</a></li><li><a href=https://chenwang.org/posts/2022-08-wise-3-years-p2/>Part II: Autonomy in the DNA</a></li><li><a href=https://chenwang.org/posts/2022-08-wise-3-years-p3/>Part III: All about People</a></li><li><a href=https://chenwang.org/posts/2022-08-wise-3-years-p4/>Part IV: Engineering Organisation</a></li><li><a href=https://chenwang.org/posts/2022-08-wise-3-years-p5/>Part VI: Other Strategic Topics</a></li><li><a href=https://chenwang.org/posts/2022-08-wise-3-years-p6/>Part VI: Not just about Work</a></li><li><a href=https://chenwang.org/posts/2022-08-wise-3-years-p7/>Part VII: Closing Thoughts</a></li></ul><p><img src=/beaworld_TransferWiseSummerDays2019.jpeg alt="beaworld festival | TransferWise Summer Days 2019">
