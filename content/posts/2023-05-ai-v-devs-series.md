With [OpenAI](https://openai.com) GPT-3.5/4 and the applications people start building on top of it, some may feel that in the year 2023, a truly revolutionary AI dawn is upon us, with a surreal sci-fi hue on the horizon. 

Software engineering is one of the most talked-about industries that have seen it coming even before 2023. Back in 2021 with GitHub Copilot’s preview release, developers have benefited from AI coding assistance for almost 2 years now. ChatGPT, released in 2022, gives a more general-purpose UX for developers to gain a productivity edge, not seen since the invention of StackOverflow, founded some 15 years ago in 2008.    

AI’s influence on software engineering going forward is a topic I’ve been thinking about and discussing in detail with various peers. This is a series of blog posts that is likely to go out of date very quickly but still worth noting down, even as outdated opinion pieces for a laugh. The idea is not to persuade anybody as the reality will likely unfold itself before our eyes sooner than we expect. 

In [Part I: Friend or Foe]({{< ref "/posts/2023-05-ai-v-devs-p1.md" >}}) I mostly make observations about recent developments in terms of AI/LLMs’ influence on software development, with light suggestions on what’s coming next for the profession. 

In [Part II: A New Beginning or The End of (Human) Programming]({{< ref "/posts/2023-05-ai-v-devs-p2.md" >}}) I make bold predictions which may be proven right or wrong very quickly given the pace of developments.
