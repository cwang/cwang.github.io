## What this site is for

I started writing more a few years ago ([speaking](../appearances/) too), perhaps as a result of realising how scalable it is as a communication channel. 

The content here are reflections on my experience, some technical others managerial. The common theme is software engineering in tech startup/scale-up environment. 

**My intention is to let readers re-live my experience (and re-think my mistakes too) in order for them to reflect on in their mindspace**. Don't forget to carry on building, equipped with your newly gained knowledge!

## Who I am

I started (or tried to start) a company during dotcom bust with a few friends, before having any work experience. That did not end well but helpfully all of us landed various jobs in tech as a result. Fast forward 20+ years later, I have not been tired of it since. 

It is a journey of discovery: trying my hands on different things, from writing tons of code to writing tons of docs :) and from a lone wolf to being responsible for packs of wolves :) My view of the industry has changed while industry itself has been changing too; the only constant is that I am still here. 

I always tell people: **I am incredibly lucky to work on the things I love, while getting paid doing it**. I am also deeply indebt to many people who have helped me along the way. For that, I say thank you and **if I cannot pay it back, I pay it forward**.

Fluffy stuff aside, 
- I was born in east coast of China, first-gen one-child-policy. 
- I live in London, UK, having spent majority of my lifetime so far there.
- I travel around between west (Europe) and east (Asia).
- I speak English and Mandarin.
- I am a dad of one (girl) and an avid runner.
