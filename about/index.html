The common theme is software engineering in tech startup/scale-up environment.</p><p><strong>My intention is to let readers re-live my experience (and re-think my mistakes too) in order for them to reflect on in their mindspace</strong>. Don&rsquo;t forget to carry on building, equipped with your newly gained knowledge!</p><h2 id=who-i-am>Who I am</h2><p>I started (or tried to start) a company during dotcom bust with a few friends, before having any work experience. That did not end well but helpfully all of us landed various jobs in tech as a result. Fast forward 20+ years later, I have not been tired of it since.</p><p>It is a journey of discovery: trying my hands on different things, from writing tons of code to writing tons of docs :) and from a lone wolf to being responsible for packs of wolves :) My view of the industry has changed while industry itself has been changing too; the only constant is that I am still here.</p><p>I always tell people: <strong>I am incredibly lucky to work on the things I love, while getting paid doing it</strong>. I am also deeply indebt to many people who have helped me along the way. For that, I say thank you and <strong>if I cannot pay it back, I pay it forward</strong>.</p><p>Fluffy stuff aside,</p><ul><li>I was born in east coast of China, first-gen one-child-policy.</li><li>I live in London, UK, having spent majority of my lifetime so far there.</li><li>I travel around between west (Europe) and east (Asia).</li><li>I speak English and Mandarin.</li><li>I am a dad of one (girl) and an avid runner.</li></ul><p>Use the <a href=../contact/>Contact Me</a> page to get in touch.</p><h2 id=how-to-work-with-me>How to work with me</h2><p><em>Let me add it later</em></p></div></div><div class="container has-text-centered"></div><div class="container has-text-centered"></div><section class=section><div class="container has-text-centered"><p>&copy; 2012-2022 Chen Wang | Built by <a href=https://github.com>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a> with <a href=https://github.com/natarajmb/charaka-hugo-theme>Charaka theme</a> | <a href=https://github.com/cwang/cwang.github.io>Source Code</a></p></div></section><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-3008ZMM0FD"></script>
