There was no name but we used a code name “project volt”. Fast forward 10 years, Volcube, as it later became known, was sold to our joint venture partner of 5 years.
Looking back, I count myself lucky as 90% of the startups fail; We managed to build a leading product in the field from scratch, with a number of customer segments spanning many countries.</description></item><item><title>JSR-223 Java Scripting API - a real world use case: success and pitfalls</title><link>https://chenwang.org/posts/2012-09-java-scripting-api/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenwang.org/posts/2012-09-java-scripting-api/</guid><description>Despite the fact that Java 6 is fast approaching EOL, certain newly added features seem to still remain relatively unknown or unused; JSR-223, the Java Scripting API is probably one of those least mentioned in “What’s New in Java 6” type articles. In this article, we will touch on a real-world use case of the new API and its programming model. Hopefully towards the end, the readers can have a better understanding of the feature and form their own opinions about the suitability for use of the API in their own projects.</description></item></channel></rss>
