It inspired this article.
These are actionable items for tech or tech-enabled startups and scale-ups going through rapid growth, resulting in the (urgent) need to make (large number of) engineering hires to support product development.
Therefore it is an action-oriented piece for “hows”. For the (explained) “whys” and (detailed) “whats”, another article titled “Hiring as a Product” is due soon.</description></item><item><title>Lessons Learned in 10 years of Volcube</title><link>https://chenwang.org/posts/2021-02-volcube-10-years-series/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenwang.org/posts/2021-02-volcube-10-years-series/</guid><description>I vividly remember the early summer of 2010, when I started writing code for a stealth-mode startup. There was no name but we used a code name “project volt”. Fast forward 10 years, Volcube, as it later became known, was sold to our joint venture partner of 5 years.
Looking back, I count myself lucky as 90% of the startups fail; We managed to build a leading product in the field from scratch, with a number of customer segments spanning many countries.</description></item><item><title>Lessons Learned in 10 years of Volcube | Part III: AOB (any other business)</title><link>https://chenwang.org/posts/2021-01-volcube-10-years-p3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenwang.org/posts/2021-01-volcube-10-years-p3/</guid><description>Co-Founders: trust and complementary skills I am grateful to have Simon as the co-founder and CEO of the business. He did everything: coming up with the idea, making big or small product decisions, even writing some code in questionable quality and most importantly, making sales. I had the easy part: building it. Having complementary skills is clearly helpful from the start.
We did not know each other prior to Volcube.</description></item><item><title>Lessons Learned in 10 years of Volcube | Part II: Engineering &amp; Design</title><link>https://chenwang.org/posts/2021-01-volcube-10-years-p2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenwang.org/posts/2021-01-volcube-10-years-p2/</guid><description>Engineering: take on technical debt options and make lucky guesses Volcube is all about trading options and I think it is a closer metaphor than debt in making engineering trade-offs. Debt will have to be repaid; options can be taken up but there is no obligation. It could be useful taking a step back to imagine a product 1/3/5 years down the line, and what would be required engineering-wise that current design would make amends.</description></item><item><title>Lessons Learned in 10 years of Volcube | Part I: Product &amp; Growth</title><link>https://chenwang.org/posts/2021-01-volcube-10-years-p1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenwang.org/posts/2021-01-volcube-10-years-p1/</guid><description>Product: (the small) addressable market size Volcube was the best product in the space it occupies, which was a market-making trading simulation and education for financial options. This may sound like a boast but let me point out the fact that it is in such a niche market, which is combined with another fact that we did well in bringing a good idea into reality. Here comes the biggest learning though: always target a market with large addressable size.</description></item><item><title>Opinionated Patterns/Practices in Java Development and Deployment, 2017 Edition</title><link>https://chenwang.org/posts/2017-03-java-dev-deploy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenwang.org/posts/2017-03-java-dev-deploy/</guid><description>Caveat Java and JVM have changed a lot since this article was written.
Read with a nostalgic lens.
Development In general Use Java 8 and use it well Use an IDE and use it well Prefer Enum over defined constant/variable Prefer standard/built-in exceptions over custom/user-defined ones Almost always use java.util.concurrent and its subpackages instead of Thread/Runnable Use Interface only when it is absolutely necessary Use Package structure wisely to avoid spaghetti code Master a build tool and stick to it For application developers Choose libraries/frameworks wisely (but still prefer the use of libraries/frameworks over BYO) Write your code so that it can be as framework-agnostic as possible (or if a framework is to be used, embrace it and its dependencies whole-heartedly) Write meaningful tests, i.</description></item><item><title>JSR-223 Java Scripting API - a Real World Use Case: Success and Pitfalls</title><link>https://chenwang.org/posts/2012-09-java-scripting-api/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenwang.org/posts/2012-09-java-scripting-api/</guid><description>Despite the fact that Java 6 is fast approaching EOL, certain newly added features seem to still remain relatively unknown or unused; JSR-223, the Java Scripting API is probably one of those least mentioned in “What’s New in Java 6” type articles. In this article, we will touch on a real-world use case of the new API and its programming model. Hopefully towards the end, the readers can have a better understanding of the feature and form their own opinions about the suitability for use of the API in their own projects.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://chenwang.org/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenwang.org/about/</guid><description>What this site is for I started writing more a few years ago, perhaps as a result of realising how scalable it is as a communication channel.
The content here are reflections on my experience, some technical others managerial. The common theme is software engineering in tech startup/scale-up environment.
My intention is to let readers re-live my experience (and re-think my mistakes too) in order for them to reflect on in their mindspace.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://chenwang.org/contact/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chenwang.org/contact/</guid><description>Ask away I am open for various opportunities.
